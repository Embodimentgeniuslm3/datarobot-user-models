Yes,M0763329,Charged Off,Avista Healthcare,< 1 year,RENT,20796.0,n,"I have 3 credit cards that I would like to payoff. The interest on each card is at 10% each. So if I consolidate all three into one and get a loan with just one interest rate, it would be great to just have 1 bill with a 10% interest rate instead of 3 cards that total 30%.. Let me make a correction...I put 10% for the credit cards. What I meant to say was I would rather pay a fixed interest rate of 10% on just one loan rather than pay a variable interest on 3 credit cards. Which each credit card is at least 18% interest.  And what makes me a good candidate for repaying this loan off is that I am in the medical field which is in high demand so I do not see myself losing my job, I am in a very well stable field. As we all know there is a high demand in the medical field right, which is where I am right now. I pay my credit cards on time. I would just like to have the one monthly payment, instead of spreading them into 3 payments. Hoping to get the help that I need, as I will not disappoint anyone who is willing to help. I would also like to add that I had the option of doing a traditional bank loan, but when I found out about this peer to peer lending, I thought it was great that there are other individuals who are willing to invest their hard earned money to help others.

A couple things you may want to know about this. oMy monthly income is $9200 and I have been with my employer for over 10 years.  My wife&rsquo;s monthly income is $3900.  Combined monthly income is $13,100.  As you can see making this payment is well within our means. oThis loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report. oThere are two homes on my credit report.  One of them is a vacation home that I rent out. oWe have a family member that lives with us who also contributes towards paying bills.  &bull;My credit card balances are high in comparison to their credit limits oAs you may be aware with the recent bank crisis many banks have started lowering credit limits on existing accounts.  Since my limits have been lowered my balance is now closer to the card limit. oBy paying off my credit cards I expect to see my credit score go back up since my total balance will be a smaller percentage of my total available credit.  My point being that I am very interested in improving my credit score so defaulting on this loan is the farthest thing from my mind.  Please feel free to share any thoughts or questions you may have. Thank you, My original description read &quot;This loan will of course be used to pay off all the credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  This should have read &quot;This loan will of course all be used to pay off credit card debt on my credit report.&quot;  Sorry for any confusion.  In reviewing the questions Lending Club investors often ask of loan requesters I found the most often is postion within their company.  I am a Government Accounts Manager.  In short, this is a sales position with a heavy emphasis on managing the relationship with a variety of high profile government customers. Kindest regards, I saw a few investors had asked other loan requesters about their 401k.  So I thought it might be relevant to add that my wife and I have a combined $120,000 in our 401ks.  I hope this will add to your confidence in funding our loan. Thank you. I want to say thank you to all of you that have invested with me so far.  I feel much better knowing that the interest I will be paying on this loan is going directly to other good people as opposed to the banks.",853xx,AZ,12.45,0.0,8/1/1997,1.0,,,6.0,0.0,92.9,27.0,False,0.0,,93%,1

I have never missed a loan/credit payment (this includes a peer to peer loan from Prosper.com that I will finish payments on in May). 2.  My income is sufficient to repay this loan (in addition to the income from my job as a Software Engineer, I also make $430/month in rental income) 3.  My job is secure (my program's largest contract was just extended for 3 years, our particular line of business is booming despite the recession) 4.  This loan's payments will be less than I currently pay on my credit card debt (minimums + $200, about $550/month) 5.  My Prosper.com loan ending in May, mentioned above has monthly payments of $506.19 that will free up some additional income for debt repayment (alternatively...I may pay this off instead of the entirety of that last credit card as this loan is at a higher rate)  All of my current monthly debt payments: 1.  Mortgage - $617.16 2.  Credit Total - $550 (minimums $350, break down above) 3.  Prosper.com - $506.19 4.
