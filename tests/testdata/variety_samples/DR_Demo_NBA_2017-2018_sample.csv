The big man has been alternating some solid efforts with some underwhelming outputs as of late, as he scored in double digits in three of the past five games while posting just two and six points, respectively, in the other two contests over that span. Kaminsky's minutes total Friday was actually his highest since the fifth game of the season back on Oct. 27, and he also drained multiple threes for the third time in the last five contests.

Fournier has missed five straight contests while nursing a right ankle sprain, though that may come to an end against the Bulls. More information should be available after Wednesday's morning shootaround, when he can test out his ankle. In his absence, Shelvin Mack, Jonathon Simmons and Mario Hezonja have all been seeing extended run. If Fournier returns, those players would likely see their roles reduced.

Once the team heads back to Orlando following Wednesday's game, Fournier will likely be reevaluated, at which point the Magic should have a better idea about his availability for Friday's home matchup with the Pelicans. Shelvin Mack is expected to pick up another start at shooting guard Wednesday with Fournier out, but with averages of 4.2 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 21.2 minutes over the last five games, he's not an especially intriguing pickup in most settings. Magic's Evan Fournier: Remains out Wednesday  (ankle) will not be available for Wednesday's game against the Bulls, Josh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel reports. While it's encouraging that Fournier was upgraded to questionable earlier in the week, there was never much of a chance that he'd return to action Wednesday.

Aldridge was particularly effective in the first half, but he ended up playing a relatively modest amount of minutes after the Warriors started pulling away in the second half. The veteran big man has scored at least 20 points in four of the last five contests, shooting between 53.3 and 71.4 percent in those games.

This is good news for the  , as Wall appears to have avoided anything serious. Still, he'll likely have the shoulder reevaluated at some point over the next few days and it remains unclear if he'll be good to go in time for Sunday's matchup with the Raptors. The fact that Wall was in a sling brings at least some concern over his availability moving forward, so continue to monitor his status over the weekend. Wizards' John Wall: Scores season-low 13 points in loss  scored 13 points (4-13 FG, 0-3 3PT, 5-12 FT) to go along with six rebounds, 15 assists, one steal and one block over 38 minutes in Friday's 130-122 loss to Cleveland. Wall still managed to dish out 15 assists while playing through a left shoulder sprain. The Washington point guard's scoring potential was obviously hampered by the injury. Owners will be able to determine Wall's status for Sunday's game against Toronto after the result of the pending X-ray is revealed. Wizards' John Wall: Will have X-ray on shoulder  suffered a left shoulder sprain during Friday's game against the Cavaliers, but played through it and posted 13 points (4-13 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 5-12 FT), six rebounds, 15 assists, one steal and four turnovers across 37 minutes. He's slated to undergo an X-ray Friday after the game, Candace Buckner of the Washington Post reports. Wall struggled offensively for much of the night, but was solid with his all-around production and was able to get his teammates involved at a high rate. He took a shot to the shoulder on a screen during the second half and while Wall didn't leave the game, he's still slated to have a precautionary X-ray to make sure there's nothing more serious at hand. Look for another update following the test, but tentatively consider Wall questionable for Sunday's game against the Raptors. Wizards' John Wall: Officially questionable to play Sunday  (shoulder) is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Toronto, the Washington Post reports. Wall banged shoulders with Channing Frye in Friday's loss to the Cavaliers and underwent an X-ray after the game, which returned negative. However, the point guard is still in significant pain and speculated that he may have sustained a stinger. ""I feel like [Frye] threw a shoulder into mine because I've split screens before and hit somebody's shoulder and their body and never had that type of injury,"" Wall said Friday. ""I think his impact and the way he was coming kind of gave me a stinger."" Regardless of the official diagnosis, the team will wait until shootaround Sunday to issue an update. In the event Wall is ruled out, Tim Frazier would be in line for increased minutes.",0.0

The Charlotte forward was deadly efficient from long range, sinking a season-high five three-pointers on nine attempts.

Ingram continues to demonstrate marked improvement over the results he generated in the first half of last year's rookie campaign, especially with his shot. Factoring in Tuesday's contest, he's now drained 50.0 percent of his attempts in three of the past four games, going 21-for-42 over that span. His contributions in other categories has been above-average for the most part as well, and he's generated back-to-back four-steal nights.

Covington left Thursday's game against the Blazers after injuring his left middle finger, but it appears he's avoided a long-term absence. If he ends up being ruled out Saturday, Justin Anderson (shin) and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot are two candidates to see expanded roles, though Anderson is doubtful. If both Covington and Anderson end up on the shelf, Jerryd Bayless and Dario Saric may end up seeing upticks in workload as well. 76ers' Robert Covington: Won't return Thursday  has been ruled out for the remainder of Thursday's game against the Trail Blazers with a left middle finger injury. Covington attempted just two field goals in 24 minutes of action before being forced out of Thursday's game with a finger injury in the third quarter. The specifics of the injury haven't been revealed, so it's too early to determine if he'll be able to suit up for Saturday's game against the Nuggets.

Covington apparently felt better than expected during morning shootaround and will see the floor Saturday. In the five games prior to injuring his finger, he was averaging 12.0 points, 4.6 rebounds, 3.2 steals and 1.6 assists per contest. 76ers' Robert Covington: Doubtful Saturday  (finger) is listed as doubtful for Saturday's contest against the Nuggets. Covington recently had X-rays come back clean, though he's still in enough discomfort to probably miss Saturday's contest. As a result, Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Jerryd Bayless and Dario Saric are all candidates to see expanded roles if Covington ends up on the shelf.",15.0

He'll likely continue to test the injury out leading up to tipoff to determine if he can take the floor. If he's held out, Kelly Oubre would likely see an expanded role.",0.0

With Kevin Durant enduring a rough night overall, Green stepped up his offensive contributions while still maintaining his typically impressive numbers in other categories. The six-year veteran now has three double-digit scoring efforts in the first five games of February, and he's tallied no less than six rebounds and assists in each contest of the month thus far. He's also put up a robust total of 33 shot attempts over the last two games combined, leading to an average of 14.5 points during that stretch. Given his penchant for above-average multi-category production, Green's fantasy stock remains high across all formats despite the high-usage profiles of his fellow first-unit teammates. Warriors' Draymond Green: Doubtful for Monday  is considered doubtful for Monday's game against the Suns due to a sprained left index finger. Green is coming off a strong performance against the Spurs on Saturday, posting 17 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds in 35 minutes, so it's unclear exactly when he suffered the injury, but it looks like it'll hold him out for at least one contest. With Green expected to be out of the lineup, both Kevon Looney and Omri Casspi should be in line for extended minutes in the frontcourt, with Green's next opportunity to return being Wednesday in Portland. Warriors' Draymond Green: Ruled out Monday  (finger) has been ruled out for Monday's game against the Suns. As expected, Green will be sidelined Monday with a sprained left index finger. There doesn't appear to be much concern surrounding Green's ailment, so it seems unlikely that his absence will extend beyond Monday's contest, but with the All-Star out of the lineup, both Kevon Looney and Omri Casspi are expected to shoulder some extra playing time in the frontcourt.",0.0
